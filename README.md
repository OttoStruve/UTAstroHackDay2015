UTAstroHackDay2015
==================

We are hosting an informal hack day, probably sometime January 13-16, 2015.

### Participants and hack ideas

### Organizers
gully and Stefano are organizing.  We two have attended international astronomy hack events in the last year, and are excited to bring this culture to UT Austin Department of Astronomy.  At the very least, Stefano and I will be in a room with our computers and you can show up.
