UTAstroHackDay2015
==================

We are hosting an informal hack day, all day on Friday, January 16, 2015 in the Astro classroom.

Visit the [wiki](https://github.com/OttoStruve/UTAstroHackDay2015/wiki) at the right for more information.


## Hack ideas
1. Visit the wiki on the right tab in this window to add yourself to the [participant     list](https://github.com/OttoStruve/UTAstroHackDay2015/wiki/Participants).
2. Check out the existing [hack ideas](https://github.com/OttoStruve/UTAstroHackDay2015/wiki/Hack-Ideas) or add one of your own.

### Participate with GitHub

1. If you don't already have a GitHub account, sign up.
2. If you're not part of UT Austin Astro's GitHub org, get [an owner](https://github.com/orgs/OttoStruve/people) to add you to it.
3. Consider [making your membership to the group public](https://help.github.com/articles/publicizing-or-concealing-organization-membership/), since the default option is to make your membership private.

### Organizers
gully and Stefano are organizing.  We two have attended international astronomy hack events in the last year, and are excited to bring this culture to UT Austin Department of Astronomy.  At the very least, Stefano and I will be in a room with our computers and you can show up.  At best we will get lunch provided.

### Provisos
1. You don't need experience to participate.
2. You can show up and leave as needed.  It's best to be there for the pitches in the morning so you know what's going on.
3. Stefano and I agree that GitHub accounts really are important to participating.  If you don't have one, follow our advice at the top of the page.
4. It's OK if you can't make it because you are out of town, we will probably have another one later in the season.
5. We have not sought any funding or support for this at the time of writing.  Basically we're just getting together in a room, it's not a big deal or anything.
6. You can absolutely work on your own research problems, so it's not a day off from research.  In fact you might get someone to help you do something new with your research.
